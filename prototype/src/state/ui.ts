 * Navigation state — what is open on screen right now.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from the world store. The world is product truth ("the user has
 * a plan, their domain is connecting"); this store is merely where the camera points
 * ("the domains surface is open, the publish popover is up"). Scenario switches and
 * flows rewrite the world; they must never have to know or care which panel happened
 * to be open. Keeping the two apart is what lets both grow for years without tangling.
 *
 * A "surface" is a module that renders in place of the site preview inside the same
 * shell — the pattern Lovable ships as its "More" section and the one Remixer already
 * uses in production. Every future module (Analytics, Library, Cloud…) becomes one
 * more entry in `Surface`, not a new layout.
